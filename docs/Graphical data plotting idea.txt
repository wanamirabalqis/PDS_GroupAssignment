3)	Top 10 – Region category Sales - Kang (Done but not for top 10)
    Note: Only have 3 category: Maybe use sub category? 
4)	Top 10 Product/Product category Discount
5)	Show Trend graph for number of order/delivery - Kang (Done)
6)	Plot Chart the price/sales based on product/product Category (Done - created trend graphc for product)
7)	Plot Sales data based on season/quarter? Done (Can be extracted from monthly view)
8)	Plot number of order vs total delivery day (total days between delivery date and order date)
