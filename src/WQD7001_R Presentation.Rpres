The idea of the trends and insights that we could get from consumer behavior is particularly interesting, hence we chose the domain â€“ E-Commerce. We believe that with proper usage of analytics on the consumer data, we can visualize and observe different kinds of consumer behaviors. 

<h3>Project Questions</h3>
- What are the trend of sales that we can observe for different categories in the past years? <br>
- What are the trend of shippings that we can observe for different region in the past years? <br>
- What are the past industry data which could provide an insight on the recent sales? <br>


Data Science Process
========================================================
<h3>Ask an intriguing question:</h3>
Do superstore owners in the US understand their sales behavior?

<h3>Obtain data:</h3>
The dataset used in this assignment is extracted from Kaggle & US Census Bureau. This dataset contains online order sales from 2014-2017 for Furniture, Office Supplies and Technology. Raw data consisted of 9,994 rows and 21 variables. US Census Bureau dataset contains annual retail, business expenses and quarterly e-commerce report from 2008 - 2018 for E-Commerce industry overlook. These datasets were then integrated for a consolidate US Superstore Dashboard Analysis.


<h3>Exploring the data:</h3>
In total there are 3 main categories: Furniture, Technology and Office Supplies. The
sales are ranging from 0.44 to 22638.480.


<h3>Cleaning the data:</h3>
The Data was cleaned by removing negative values. The date in the data was 
converted to correct format. 

<h3>Model the data:</h3>
New feature: delivery days, date(day, month year) have been added to provide more report possibility. 

<h3>Data visualization:</h3>
Generated a Shiny app with 4 tabs that show: Sales Overview, Product Dashboard, Delivery Dashboard, and Industry Overlook which is posted in shinyapp.io.

<h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
- Most of us are beginners with R coding, took a lot of perseverance and intensive studying to complete the development of the app
- Difficulty in doing group discussions due to the pandemic. Discussions on Microsoft Teams made it easier for us to connect and work together to complete the project.
